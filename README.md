# payments-in-europe-paper

This repository holds my paper on payments in Europe.
It was originally written as a seminar paper as part of my master's studies at Wilhelm Büchner Hochschule.

You can read

* my working copy in [Markdown](payments-in-europe-paper.md) format (GitHub renders this nicely) or
* the version I submitted to university in [Microsoft Word](payments-in-europe-paper.docx) or [PDF](payments-in-europe-paper.pdf) format.
